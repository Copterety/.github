GITHUBBERS, a database for you, of code pieces you use and will reuse, and I send you requested saved code pieces upon email request, based on how you reference them specifically, in language and character sets accustomed to your thinking, for you to use in present programming, so you don't have to think again, only piece your thinking blocks together, and make more money and spent less time making more money. Fee up for discussion.
